## FAQ-Managment

This project is a FAQ management system that supports multilingual FAQs, allowing users to add, edit, delete and retrieve FAQs in multiple languages. It uses Django with the `django-ckeditor` WYSIWYG editor, Google Translate API for automatic translations, Redis caching for improved performance, and a REST API to manage the FAQ entries.
